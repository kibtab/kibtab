/*  Reveal the open page's entry in the Furo sidebar drawer.
 *
 *  Ported from adacovex.
 *
 *  The documentation is a page per section, so the global toctree is far
 *  taller than the drawer.  A reader who clicks a late entry lands on a page
 *  whose own entry sits below the drawer's fold, and the drawer stays where
 *  it was: the sidebar click looks like it went nowhere.  Furo reveals its
 *  right-hand table of contents only, so nothing else moves the drawer.
 *
 *  This script moves it.  The drawer (.sidebar-scroll) is the only scroll
 *  container involved: the page itself never moves, and the drawer alone
 *  takes the scroll offset.  An entry already comfortably in view is left
 *  alone, so the drawer does not jump under a reader who has just scrolled
 *  it.  Otherwise the entry lands a quarter of the way down the drawer,
 *  which keeps its caption and the entries after it on screen too.
 *
 *  The entry is found two ways.  Sphinx marks the open page with
 *  `li.current-page > a.current`; the documentation index is the root
 *  document, which no toctree may reference, so it carries no such class and
 *  is matched by path instead.  Both lookups resolve the link against the
 *  document, so `/`, `//`, and `/index.html` agree.  A page no toctree
 *  names -- a changelog page, the search page -- has no entry of its own,
 *  and the drawer then stays where it is.
 *
 *  The reveal runs once the document is parsed.
